# Weightless Neural Networks (WNN) - Comparison

This project compares 4 different types of binarization used as a preprocessing phase for an image classification task. The Neural Network is the WiSARD model. See [wisardpkg 1.6.3](https://pypi.org/project/wisardpkg/) for more details on how to use wisardpkg. The data was taken from [Kuzushiji-MNIST Dataset](https://github.com/rois-codh/kmnist) which is a similar dataset to MNIST.  

Run each python "kmnist-x" file indivually to obtain the results of each method used for each tuple size of the WiSARD model. The full report is described in the "Trabalho-Kmnist.pdf" file (in portuguese). The results of these programs are summarized in "Figura 2(a)"

## Necessary technologies:
  - python 3.9.5 
  - conda 23.9.0 
  - wisardpkg 1.6.3
